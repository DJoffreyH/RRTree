**Comparative Analysis:**

*   **AI_Performance_Benchmark_Suite (Baseline):** Provided the original description of the task, without specific output.
*   **baserrt:**
    *   **Core Conclusion:** Believed that "zoning reform" is more fundamental in solving the problem, while "rent control" has significant long-term negative effects.
    *   **Depth of Analysis and Justification:** Compared the three dimensions in detail: speed of effect and beneficiary groups, long-term market impact, and political feasibility, and provided sufficient reasons.
        *   **Speed of Effect:** Believed rent control is faster but benefits limited groups.
        *   **Long-term Market Impact:** Emphasized that rent control suppresses new supply, while zoning reform increases supply.
        *   **Political Feasibility:** Believed rent control is easier to gain political support, while zoning reform faces greater resistance.
        *   **Policy Recommendation:** Proposed a combination approach with "increasing supply" as the core, supplemented by "rent subsidies" instead of "rent control."
*   **rawagent:**
    *   **Core Conclusion:** Highly consistent with baserrt, believing that "zoning reform" is a fundamental solution, while "rent control" is a superficial one.
    *   **Depth of Analysis and Justification:** Analysis dimensions and reasons were highly consistent with baserrt, almost verbatim. Also emphasized the fundamental advantage of zoning reform in solving the housing crisis.
