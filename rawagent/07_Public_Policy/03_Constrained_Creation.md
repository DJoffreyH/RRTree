SUBJECT: Policy Proposal: Comprehensive Smoking Ban in City Parks

**1. Problem Statement**

City parks are intended for public recreation and promoting healthy lifestyles. However, public exposure to secondhand smoke and environmental litter from cigarette butts remain significant issues. According to the City Public Health Department, over 70% of park visitors report having been exposed to secondhand smoke. This exposure poses a health risk to non-smokers, particularly children and the elderly. Additionally, cigarette butts are the most commonly littered item, creating environmental pollution and fire hazards.

**2. Proposed Policy**

It is proposed that a comprehensive smoking ban be implemented across all city-owned and operated parks. The ban would prohibit the use of all combustible tobacco products, including cigarettes, cigars, and pipes, within the boundaries of these public spaces. Clear signage would be installed at all park entrances and high-traffic areas to delineate the smoke-free policy.

**3. Key Considerations**

Successful implementation requires careful planning in three key areas:

*   **Public Education:** A robust public awareness campaign will be necessary to inform residents and visitors of the new rule before it takes effect.
*   **Enforcement Strategy:** A clear protocol for enforcement needs to be established, outlining the roles of park rangers and local police, and whether the approach will be educational initially or punitive.
*   **Impact on Tourism:** An assessment of the potential impact on tourism, both positive and negative, should be considered.
