On June 6, 1944, Allied forces commenced Operation Overlord, a large-scale amphibious invasion of Normandy, France. Under the command of Dwight D. Eisenhower (Allied Supreme Commander), approximately 150,000 soldiers from American, British, and Canadian units landed on five designated beaches. The primary strategic objective of this operation was to establish a second front in Western Europe, thereby compelling Germany to divert resources from the Eastern Front. The landings marked the beginning of a sustained campaign to liberate German-occupied territories. The operation required extensive planning and coordination, involving naval, air, and ground forces to secure a foothold on the continent for future advances.
