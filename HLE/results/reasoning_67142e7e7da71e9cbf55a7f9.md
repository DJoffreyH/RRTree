          (C_on_C4 "-CH(CH3)2": two methyl groups. Because C4 is a chiral center, these two methyls are diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent. They should give two separate quartet signals. This would mean the structure has 7 signals in total.")
        (reconcile_with_hint "The data has 6 signals. The hint says 'there may be signal overlapping'. The two diastereotopic methyls on C4 are expected to have very similar chemical shifts. It is highly plausible that their signals are accidentally degenerate (overlap) or that one of them overlaps with the signal from the methyl on C2. This provides a perfect explanation for seeing only 6 signals."))))

    (final_answer "2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene")
    (confidence "High. The proposed structure perfectly matches all spectral data and provides a strong, chemically sound explanation for the hint."))
