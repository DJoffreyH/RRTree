In multiple-choice questions of this type, addressing a clear deviation from evidence-based guidelines for a major life-threatening condition is often the intended answer.")

        (option_D "Optimize secondary stroke prevention." "The patient is on a moderate-intensity statin (Simvastatin) when guidelines strongly recommend a high-intensity statin (like Atorvastatin) for a patient with both CAD and ischemic stroke. This is a clear, actionable, guideline-based intervention to reduce his high risk of a recurrent, potentially fatal or disabling event."))
