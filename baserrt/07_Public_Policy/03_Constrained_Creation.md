**TO:** Mayor's Office
**FROM:** Policy Analyst
**DATE:** July 20, 2025
**SUBJECT:** Policy Proposal: Comprehensive Smoking Ban in City Parks

**1. Problem Statement**

City parks are intended to be healthy, welcoming environments for all residents. However, the prevalence of smoking in these public spaces poses significant challenges. Secondhand smoke presents a health risk to non-smokers, particularly children and the elderly. According to the City Public Health Department's survey, over 70% of park visitors report having been exposed to secondhand smoke. Additionally, discarded cigarette butts are a primary source of litter, negatively impacting the parks' environmental quality and cleanliness.

**2. Proposed Policy**

It is proposed that the city implement a comprehensive smoking ban in all municipally-owned and operated parks. This policy would prohibit any form of smoking, including e-cigarettes, within the designated boundaries of all city parks, playgrounds, and recreational areas. Clear signage would be installed at all park entrances and key locations to inform the public of this regulation.

**3. Key Considerations**

For erfolgreiche implementation, the following factors require careful consideration:

*   **Public Education:** A robust public awareness campaign will be necessary to educate residents and visitors about the new policy and the reasons behind it.
*   **Enforcement:** A clear plan for enforcement must be established, defining the roles and responsibilities of park staff and local law enforcement, and outlining a phased approach starting with warnings.
*   **Impact on Tourism:** An assessment of the potential impact on tourists and the hospitality sector should be conducted.
